### Hi there, I'm Aleksandr ðŸ‘‹

**Full-stack engineer Â· Node.js/TypeScript Â· DevOps & Observability Â· Data pipelines**

I build reliable data and back-office systems, mostly in finance.  
Modernizing legacy stacks to **Node 22 (ESM)**, designing task runners over **MSSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ**, and instrumenting services with **OpenTelemetry, Promtail/Loki, Grafana, Jaeger**. I ship containerized deployments (**Docker/PM2**) and maintain **GitLab CI/CD** pipelines.

**Current focus:** Robust backend APIs and platform reliability. XSLT3/Saxon flows, FOâ†’PDF generation, cryptographic signing workflows, and smarter logging/alerts.

**Also exploring:** AI-assisted dev (MCP, Cluade Code style tools), iOS experiments, and building **Swift (iOS) pet projects**.

**Open to:** remote part-time or contract engagements â€” backend Node.js, platform/DevOps, or data ingestion pipelines. Working comfortably across EU/Asia time zones.

I build small, useful pet projects to solve real problems and share them here.  
Issues/PRs are welcome â€” and thanks for using my code!


Thanks for using my code!
